# Description Of How The Gameplay Works
The game is ballanced using fixed values defined in `GameRules.hpp`
## Overview

The game takes place in a continuous (non-discrete) square area with sides of length `GAME_SIZE`. Each player begins with a `Nest` and a starting number of `Bugs`, as defined by `STARTING_BUG_COUNT`, which initially spawn in the `Nest`. The game world is also populated with randomly placed `Plants`, up to a maximum limit defined by `MAX_NUMBER_OF_PLANTS`.

After the game starts, each `Player` is sent a subset of the worldâ€™s entities. This subset is determined by the visibility range from their `Nest` and `Bugs`, which is defined by a circular area with a radius of `NEST_VIEW_DISTANCE` for the `Nest` and `BUG_VIEW_DISTANCE` for each `Bug`.

Once the game world is initialized, the `Player` is prompted to take its turn. During a turn, the `Player` can issue instructions for each of its `Bugs`. Each `Bug` can perform one action per turn. The available actions include: `Move`, `Attack Bug`, `Eat Plant`, `Heal`, and `Reproduce`.

After all `Players` have submitted their actions, the game processes these actions and updates the game world. This cycle repeats until all but one `Player` have been eliminated, and the last remaining `Player` is declared the victor.

## Game Mechanics and Rules

Each `Bug` has three attributes: `Location`, `Health`, and `Energy`. `Energy` is the key resource in the game and can be collected by eating `Plants` or by killing and devouring enemy `Bugs`. However, `Energy` is also consumed when performing most actions during a turn. The `Energy` consumption is defined by the following constants: `ENERGY_COST_PER_PERCENTAGE_OF_MAX_DISTANCE_MOVED`, `ENERGY_COST_PER_ATTACK_POINT_DEALT`, `ENERGY_COST_TO_REPRODUCE`, and `ENERGY_COST_PER_HEALTH_POINT_HEALED`. Eating `Plants` does not cost `Energy`. If a `Bug` runs out of `Energy`, it can still survive but is limited to the actions `Eat Plant` and `Move`. When the `Bug` has zero `Enegy` the `Move` action is treated as a 'free' action. 

When performing an `Eat Plant` action, the `Bug` must be within `MAX_PLANT_EATING_DISTANCE` of the `Plant` for the action to be valid. Upon consuming a `Plant`, the `Bug` receives an `Energy` boost equal to `PLANT_ENERGY`. If multiple `Bugs` eat the same `Plant` in one turn the food is shared evenly. `Plants` continuously respawn in the game world at randomized locations, at a rate defined by `PLANT_SPAWN_RATE` per turn, up to the maximum limit of `MAX_NUMBER_OF_PLANTS`. 

When attacking another `Bug` using the `Attack Bug` action, the attacking `Bug` must be within `MAX_BUG_ATTACK_DISTANCE` of the target for the action to be valid. If a `Bug's` `Health` drops below zero during a turn, it dies. When this occurs, its remaining `Energy` is distributed proportionally to all `Bugs` that attacked it during that turn, based on how much attack each contributed. 

The amount of `Energy` a `Bug` has also affects its stats during gameplay. The maximum attack and movement distance a `Bug` can perform in a turn are influenced by its `Energy` level, as follows: 

### $$\text{Max Attack} = 0.5 \cdot \log_{10}(\text{energy}^2 + 2)$$

###  $$\text{Max Speed} = 0.5 + \frac{12 \cdot \text{energy}^{0.1}}{\text{energy}^{0.4} + \text{energy}^{0.1} + 1.6}$$

Similarly, the maximum `Health` of a `Bug` scales with its `Energy`: 

### $$\text{Max Health} = 5 \cdot \log_{10}(\text{energy}^2 + 2)$$

If the maximum `Health` of a `Bug` drops below its current `Health`, the current `Health` is not affected. Maximum `Health` is only relevant during a `Heal` action. The `Bug` provides member functions to query these stats (`GetMaxAttack`, `GetMaxHealth`, and `GetMaxSpeed`). The Heal action has a fixed limit per turn, defined by `MAX_HEAL_PER_TURN`. 

When performing `Heal` and `Attack Bug` actions, a `Bug` that is within its `Nest's` radius (`NEST_EFFECT_RADIUS`) gains a bonus multiplier applied to the usual maximum values. This bonus is defined by `HEAL_BONUS_FOR_BUGS_NEAR_NEST` for healing and `ATTACK_BONUS_FOR_BUGS_NEAR_NEST` for attacking.
